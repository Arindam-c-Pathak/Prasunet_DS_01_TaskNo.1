                Welcome, this is my work for the task provided by Prasunet Company in Web Development.
                Different ways to do the same thing can be applied here. 
                I have used HTML to create the base of the project, including this paragraph and any other text.
                CSS was used to add the style that I wanted to the HTML file.
                JavaScript was the final addition to make the navigation bar interactive by changing colors when the cursor is hovering over the text.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a student in the field of Computer Science & Engineering, so this project has been very interesting to me.
