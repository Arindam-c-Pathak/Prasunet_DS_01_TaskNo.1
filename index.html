                Welcome, this is my work for the task provided by Prasunet Company in Web Development.
                Different ways to do the same thing can be applied here. 
                I have used HTML to create the base of the project, including this paragraph and any other text.
                CSS was used to add the style that I wanted to the HTML file.
                JavaScript was the final addition to make the navigation bar interactive by changing colors when the cursor is hovering over the text.

            <p>
                I am a student in the field of Computer Science & Engineering, so this project has been very interesting to me. 
                All the relevant details about me can be found through my LinkedIn profile that is linked in the contacts at the bottom of the page.

            <h1>Services Provided</h1>
            <p>
                Although I am still learning, there is little doubt in my mind that there will be any problems with me using various programming languages.
                The services that I can provide include the use of Python, C, C++, and recently added quite slow usage of Java and SQL.
